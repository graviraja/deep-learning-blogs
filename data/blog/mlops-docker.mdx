Why do we need packaging? We might have to share our application with others, and when they try to run the application most of the time it doesn‚Äôt run due to dependencies issues / OS related issues and for that, we say (famous quote across engineers) that `It works on my laptop/system`.

So for others to run the applications they have to set up the same environment as it was run on the host side which means a lot of manual configuration and installation of components.

The solution to these limitations is a technology called `Containers`.

By containerizing/packaging the application, we can run the application on any cloud platform to get advantages of managed services and autoscaling and reliability, and many more.

The most prominent tool to do the packaging of application is `Docker üõ≥`

In this post, I will be going through the following topics:

- `FastAPI wrapper`
- `Basics of Docker`
- `Building Docker Container`
- `Docker Compose`

## ‚ö°Ô∏è FastAPI wrapper

We have built a nice application. But it is of no use if there is not a way to access by other people. Let's build a API around the application we built.

I will be using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for this purpose (since it is fast and very easy to get started).

#### üèó Installation

```shell
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn
```

Create a file called `app.py` and import FastAPI as following:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI(title="MLOps Basics App")
```

Now we can use this app to create the required routes

```python
@app.get("/")
async def home():
    return "<h2>This is a sample NLP Project</h2>"
```

Now Let's run the application using the command

```shell
uvicorn app:app --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Now open the browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

The advantage of using `FastAPI ‚ö°Ô∏è` it has inbuilt swagger documentation linking. Open this link [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

It will look something like this:

![normal](/static/images/docker/fastapi_1.png)

Now let's create an API which will take `text` as input and returns the prediction.

```python
from inference_onnx import ColaONNXPredictor

# load the model
predictor = ColaONNXPredictor("./models/model.onnx")

@app.get("/predict")
async def get_prediction(text: str):
    result =  predictor.predict(text)
    return result
```

Run the application using the command:

```shell
uvicorn app:app --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

This [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) will look like this:

![normal](/static/images/docker/fastapi_2.png)

Now you run the get the predictions directly by calling this `/predict` api.

## üõ≥ Basics of Docker

Docker is a container management tool, which packages the application code, configuration, and dependencies into a portable image that can be shared and run on any platform or system.

There are three three main things in docker:

- `Docker File`
- `Docker Image`
- `Docker Container`

A `Docker File` contains the list of commands to run which are necessary for the application to run (like dependencies, codes, command to run etc.)

A `Docker Image` is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software (built using dockerfile) that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

A `Docker Container` is an instance of Docker Image which contains the running application.

![normal](/static/images/docker/docker_arch.png)

## üõ≥ Building Docker Container

Let's package the application using docker.

_Note: I am doing this only for inference (trained model) can also be used for training._

### üìù Docker File

A simple file that consists of instructions to build a Docker Image. Each instruction in a docker file is a command/operation, for example, what operating system to use, what dependencies to install or how to compile the code, and many such instructions which act as a layer.

The best part is all layers are cached and if we modified some instructions in the Dockerfile then during the build process it will just rebuild the changed layer.

A sample Dockerfile will look as below

```
FROM huggingface/transformers-pytorch-cpu:latest
COPY ./ /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements_inference.txt
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

- `FROM`: creates a layer from the base image, here we have used `huggingface/transformers-pytorch-cpu:latest` Docker image. This is pulled from Docker Hub.
- `WORKDIR`: specifies the working directory
- `COPY`: adds files from your Docker client‚Äôs or host system current directory, here we are adding current directory files to the container‚Äôs app directory
- `RUN`: specifies what commands to run within the container, here running pip command to install dependencies from `requirements_inference.txt` file
- `EXPOSE`: specifies which port to expose our application, here it‚Äôs 8000
- `CMD`: specifies what command to run at the start of the container

### üåâ Docker Image

Now let's build the Docker Image üåâ using the command:

```shell
docker build -t inference:latest .
```

Once the image is built, cross check it using the command:

```shell
docker images
```

You will see output something like this:

```
REPOSITORY          TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
inference           latest       d4aa9dad9eaa   1 hours ago   3.12GB
```

### üì¶ Docker Container

Now let's create the container from the image created using the command:

```shell
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name inference_container inference:latest
```

You are saying to create a docker container with name `inference_container` using the docker image `infenrece:latest`. Tie the port `8000` with the port `8000` of the docker container.
You will see output something like:

```
(week5) ravirajas-MacBook-Pro MLOps-Basics/week_5_docker ‚Äπweek5*‚Ä∫ ¬ª docker run -p 8000:8000 --name inference_container inference:latest

INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## üö¢ Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application‚Äôs services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Let's see how to create a `compose yaml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  prediction_api:
    build: .
    container_name: 'inference_container'
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
```

- `Services`: These are the multiple docker containers which needs to be created (in our case it's only one)

Now simply run the command:

```
docker-compose up
```

You will output something like:

```
(base) ravirajas-MacBook-Pro MLOps-Basics/week_5_docker ‚Äπweek5*‚Ä∫ ¬ª docker-compose up
Starting prediction_api ... done
Attaching to inference_container
inference_container    | INFO:     Started server process [1]
inference_container    | INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
inference_container    | INFO:     Application startup complete.
inference_container    | INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## ü•Ç Sharing

Now sharing can be done in 2 ways:

- Commit the `Dockerfile` which can be used to build the image and container
- Push the docker image to a central repository like [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and pull it from there.

![hub](/static/images/docker/hub_flow.jpeg)

You need to create an account in docker hub in-order to be able to push the image. Refer to this [documentation for more information](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#:~:text=To%20push%20an%20image%20to,docs%2Fbase%3Atesting%20).
